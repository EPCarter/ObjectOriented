 * @summary 3 (Compute greatest common divisor using recursion) The gcd(m, n)
 *          can also be defined recursively as follows:
 * 
 *          If m % n is 0, gcd(m, n) is n.
 * 
 *          Otherwise, gcd(m, n) is gcd(n, m % n).
 * 
 *          Write a recursive method to find the GCD. Write a test program that
 *          prompts the user to enter two integers and displays their GCD.
