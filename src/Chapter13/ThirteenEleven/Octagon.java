 * @summary (The Octagon class) Write a class named Octagon that extends
 *          GeometricObject and implements the Comparable and Cloneable
 *          interfaces. Assume that all eight sides of the octagon are of equal
 *          length. The area can be computed using the following formula:
 * 
 *          Area = (2 + 4/sqrt(2)) * side * side
 * 
 *          Draw the UML diagram that involves Octagon, GeometricObject,
 *          Comparable, and Cloneable. Write a test program that creates an
 *          Octagon object. Refer to pages 514-515 for an example of clone()
