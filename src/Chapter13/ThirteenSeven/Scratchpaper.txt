 * @summary (The Colorable interface) Design an interface named Colorable with a
 *          void method named howToColor(). Every class of a colorable object
 *          must implement the Colorable interface.
 * 
 *          Design a class named Square that extends GeometricObject and
 *          implements Colorable. Implement howToColor to display the message
 *          Color all four sides.
 * 
 *          Draw a UML diagram that involves Colorable, Square, and
 *          GeometricObject. Write a test program that creates an array of five
 *          GeometricObjects. For each object in the array, display its area and
 *          invoke its howToColor method if it is colorable.
