 * @summary (Random time) Modify the ClockPane class with three new Boolean
 *          properties— hourHandVisible, minuteHandVisible, and
 *          secondHandVisible—and their associated accessor and mutator methods.
 *          You can use the set methods to make a hand visible or invisible.
 *          Write a test program that displays only the hour and minute hands.
 *          The hour and minute values are randomly generated. The hour is
 *          between 0 and 11, and the minute is either 0 or 30.
