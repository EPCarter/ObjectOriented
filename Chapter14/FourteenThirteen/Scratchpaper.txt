 * @summary (Display a pie chart) Write a program that uses a pie chart to
 *          display the percentages of the overall grade represented by
 *          projects, quizzes, midterm exams, and the final exam, as shown
 *          below.
 * 
 *          Suppose that projects take 20 percent and are displayed in red,
 *          quizzes take 10 percent and are displayed in blue, midterm exams
 *          take 30 percent and are displayed in green, and the final exam takes
 *          40 percent and is displayed in orange. Use the Arc class to display
 *          the pies. Interested readers may explore the JavaFX PieChart class
 *          for further study.
