 * @summary (Subclasses of Account) In Programming Exercise 9.7, the Account
 *          class was defined to model a bank account. An account has the
 *          properties account number, balance, annual interest rate, and date
 *          created, and methods to deposit and withdraw funds. Create two
 *          subclasses for checking and saving accounts. A checking account has
 *          an overdraft limit, but a savings account cannot be overdrawn. Draw
 *          the UML diagram for the classes and then implement them. Write a
 *          test program that creates objects of Account, SavingsAccount, and
 *          CheckingAccount and invokes their toString() methods.
