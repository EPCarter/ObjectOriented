 * @summary (Restore objects from a file) Suppose a file named Exercise17_07.dat
 *          has been created using the ObjectOutputStream. The file contains
 *          Loan objects. The Loan class in Listing 10.2 does not implement
 *          Serializable. Rewrite the Loan class to implement Serializable.
 *          Write a program that reads the Loan objects from the file and
 *          displays the total loan amount. Suppose you don’t know how many Loan
 *          objects are there in the file, use EOFException to end the loop.
